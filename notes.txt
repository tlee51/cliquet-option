1. For server: Have tradeID and price in the URL, and page displays these two
2. For server: Right now the page displays a lot of info, make it so it has so, r, sigma, and just T so nresets is implicit
3. For client: Have timestamp for when we issue request (request sent at this time: and also response received for trade at time: ). 
And try to line up tradeid and timestamp 
4. Deploy on cloud. For now, just zip and send and include instructions/install details in a txt file 



For one and two, price endpoint with tradeID and minimum parameters in the URL. And return only tradeID and price with two decimals. 
And don't use global cap and local cap so this makes it more dynamic.
